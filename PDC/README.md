Chapter 01 code
humne ek file bnai hai jismein hum tribonacci series ko calculate kr rhe hain aur phr usko ek 
list mein save krwa rhe hain. now this foel is inmprted to the main file where this file is 
going to be run first without using process or thread just simply it will be calculated and will be saved in the list, then it is calculated using a process and at last using a thread. ab in sb mein time kitna lagega ye calculate ho kr output mein dega ye program just.

conclusion of the code is the process is going to take longer time than a thread or simple calculation
